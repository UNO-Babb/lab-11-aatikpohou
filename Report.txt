When I changed the customer number to 5 and number of checker to 5, I thought that the idle total idle time would be less than 500 but it went up to 750 with an average time of 1.70 minutes. When I then changed the number of checker to 4 the avarage waittime was still close to 1.70 minutes but the total idle time dropped to 572 minutes
But when I changed the number of checker to 1 with still 5 customer the average wait time is 3.90 minutes but the total Idle time dropped to 30 minutes.
That means that to keep the idle time low means to have less checker when there's less customer.
I was surprised when I changed the customer number to 20 and checker to 5. The average low time is 1.64 minutes but the total iddle time was 756 minutes. And when I reduced the checker number to 1 the total idle times dropes to 31 minutes with the average wait time of 3.75 minutes.
